Proper optimization methods to solve the non-convex problem in deep learning is still an open question. In fact, we are empirically using some brute force methods to find the optimal parameter estimation in almost all deep learning applications. In those brute force methods, gradient and its calculation play a key role and therefore it is the soul of deep learning.\n","\n","**Task description**: in this task, we investigate the inner working mechanism of Tensorflow. A BIG remark first. Different from the previous task, We will try to get rid of the bondage of Keras, bypass the \"model compile -> model training\" routine, and use the gradient calculation function of Tensorflow to implement the gradient descent algorithm through our own code.\n","\n","There will be 3 subtasks. First, we learn how to calculate the gradient in Tensorflow. Second, implement the Gradient descent algorithm to a simple numerical problem. Third, apply the Gradient descent algorithm to learn a simple linear regression model.
